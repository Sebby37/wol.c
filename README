wol.c
This is an implementation of Wake-On-LAN in pure GNU C99 that uses ZERO header includes, meaning no standard libraries. Wrote it originally in an afternoon. 
It implements 4 syscalls: write(), socket(), setsockopt() and sendto() as inline assembly, and runs on Linux in both x86_64 and aarch64 architectures! 
It has proper error checking on the socket syscalls, returning the errno as the return code on some sort of failure.

To build it, simply run `make`, and to clean it run `make clean`. For a debug build run `make debug`, and for an optimized release build run `make release`.
To run it, run `./wol "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff"`, but replace the bogus one with a real one. If run without an argument, some help dialogue is printed.

Why did I make this?
- I wanted a dedicated program to turn my PC on remotely that I could run via Termux instead of a dedicated app
- I wanted said program to be very lightweight, and for the fun of it I decided to do it without any standard libraries whatsoever
- C is fun and Sockets are fun
- I wanted to write a bit of assembly and learn a lil' about how syscalls actually work in assembly (hint: very easily)
- I wanted to try write cross-platform code in C so it would run on both my laptop and my phone (via Termux)
- This project has happened to be very fun to work on, and I've been trying to get it to be as "perfect" as possible given my vision for it

What are my goals for this?
- I want a pure C Wake-On-Lan implementation that forgoes the use of any external libraries or header files
- I want the entire program to lie in one single .c file
- I want it to natively run on x86_64 and aarch64 Linux, the latter of which specifically being Termux on my Android phone
- I want it to only do Wake-On-Lan and nothing else, being optimized entirely for this purpose
- I want the code to be as optimized as possible, running as quickly as possible and with as little memory footprint as possible
- I want to have fun writing this and for this to be an educational endeavour too, to learn a bit about aarch64, Linux syscalls and executable ABIs
